Every ecosystem brings its own deterministic presence test: pclntab
dead-code-elimination evidence and govulncheck for Go, the dynamic linker's
DT_NEEDED closure for OS packages, and the installed-distribution manifest plus
a static import closure for Python and npm. The LLM, if enabled, only ever
comments on what those tests could not rule out.

Usage:
  vexscan --image  REF  (--package SPEC... | --cves LIST | --all) [flags]
  vexscan --rootfs DIR  (--package SPEC... | --cves LIST | --all) [flags]
  vexscan --repo   REPO (--package SPEC... | --cves LIST | --all) [flags]
  vexscan --rpm    FILE (--package SPEC... | --cves LIST | --all) [flags]
  vexscan --sbom   FILE (--package SPEC... | --cves LIST | --all) [flags]
  vexscan --version

--rootfs runs the same analysis against a tree already on disk. It arrives with
no image config, so nothing declares an entrypoint: the language plugins mark
their conclusions undetermined and the shared-library closure falls back to
rooting every program it finds. Pass --roots to say what actually runs.

--rpm and --sbom scan packages nobody installed, so there is no filesystem to
trace and no reachability test can run. --rpm still reads each header's file
list, which is enough to rule out a package that ships no executable code at
all; a CycloneDX component carries no file list, so --sbom can rule out nothing
and every finding it produces is undetermined. The report says so at both ends.
Use them to triage a build artifact or a bill of materials; scan the image or
the tree when you want an answer about whether the code can run.

  syft debian:12 -o cyclonedx-json | vexscan --sbom - --all
  vexscan --sbom bom.json --all --ecosystem golang

--llm has no default provider. Point it at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, at a
model running on this machine, or at a CLI you already have logged in:

  --llm-endpoint https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions   # VEXSCAN_LLM_TOKEN
  --llm-endpoint http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions --llm-model llama3.1
  --llm-command 'claude -p'

Whichever you pick cannot change a deterministic conclusion: the verdict is an
overlay on a finding that already has a status, and a mined symbol is checked
against the artifact before it can support one.

A --package SPEC is a purl, an "ecosystem:name" shorthand, or a bare name
resolved against whatever inventory contains it:

--triage answers a question severity does not: is anyone exploiting this? It
downloads EPSS (a 30-day exploitation-activity forecast, per CVE) and CISA's
known-exploited catalog, and reorders the table by them. Neither feed changes a
status or a severity: whether a vulnerability is being exploited elsewhere says
nothing about whether the code is present here. Both are keyed by CVE, so an
advisory that never got one cannot be scored, and the report names those rather
than filing them as zero. Absence from the KEV catalog means nothing at all.

Advisories come from api.osv.dev unless you say otherwise. Two flags say
otherwise, and they differ in who decides which advisories apply, not just in
where the bytes come from:

  vexscan --image myorg/app:latest --all --osv-url http://osv-proxy.corp:8000
  gsutil -m rsync -r gs://osv-vulnerabilities /srv/osv
  vexscan --image myorg/app:latest --all --osv-dir /srv/osv

--osv-url still queries a v1 OSV API, just a different one: a caching proxy in
front of osv.dev, or a mirror serving your own feed. osv.dev still matches the
installed version against each advisory's ranges. Use it to cut egress or to
pin a scan to a vendor's advisory set.

--osv-dir needs no server at all. It reads OSV's published data export -- the
same records the API serves -- from a directory or an all.zip, which makes it
the flag for a host with no network. The version matching then happens on this
machine, against dpkg, rpm, apk and semver ordering. Where no comparator can
order an ecosystem the advisory is kept rather than dropped, and the report
says how many and which: over-matching costs a reader a dismissal, and
under-matching costs them the vulnerability. Pass one or the other, never both.

--version prints vexscan's own version and exits. It used to mean "override the
module version read from a binary's build info"; that setting is now spelled
--module-version, and --version=VERSION still works with a warning for one more
release. vexscan takes no positional arguments, so "--version 1.2.3" is an
error rather than a scan of the wrong version.

A report longer than one screen is paged through $VEXSCAN_PAGER, $PAGER or
less, and repeats its summary and any INCOMPLETE notes at the bottom. Piped,
redirected or written with --out it is never paged, and the bytes are the same
either way. --no-pager turns it off for one run; VEXSCAN_PAGER= for good.

--color auto (the default) colours the text report on a terminal and nowhere
else: not into a pipe, not into --out, not into a --gist, not into JSON, and
not when NO_COLOR is set. --color always overrides all of that except JSON, for
piping into "less -R". Nothing is said in colour alone -- stripping the escapes
from a coloured report reproduces the plain one byte for byte.

--fail-on gates a pipeline on the findings. It is off by default, and it counts
only findings whose vulnerable code is present and loadable, unless
--fail-on-status widens it:

  vexscan --image myorg/app:latest --all --fail-on high
  vexscan --image myorg/app:latest --all --fail-on any --fail-on-status affected,undetermined

That default is the difference worth having. "--fail-on high" here means a HIGH
whose code the closure actually reached, not a HIGH whose version string
appears in a package database -- so a passing gate is a statement about the
image rather than about a filter. Severities order as the table orders them, so
an unrated finding counts from MEDIUM down; above that it cannot be weighed,
and the run says how many it could not weigh rather than passing quietly.

Exit status:
  0  the scan completed
  1  the scan failed, or an ecosystem could not be read (the report says which)
  2  the command line was wrong
  3  the scan completed and --fail-on matched (never mixed with 1: a broken
     scan is not a clean gate, and its findings are not counted at all)
