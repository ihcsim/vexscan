// The shape is a table rather than a block per finding because of what a real
// scan produces: debian:12 --all is 159 findings, which as blocks was 647 lines
// nobody reads to the end of. The per-finding detail is not gone, it moved
// behind --details.
//
// Plain aligned columns, not box drawing. These reports are pasted into gists,
// CI logs and terminals of every width, and are grepped and cut. A row that
// survives all of that is worth more than one that looks better in a
// screenshot.
//
// Colour is the one exception, and is held to the same rule: it is carried in a
// palette that is empty unless a human is watching (color.go), it is never the
// only thing saying something, and stripping the escapes from a coloured report
// reproduces the uncoloured one byte for byte. A file, a gist and a pipe get the
// empty palette, so the bytes that get diffed and grepped are unchanged --
// including the footer below, whose threshold is counted in the report's own
// lines and never in the terminal's height.

// renderOpts is how a report is rendered, as opposed to what is in it.
//
// One struct rather than two parameters because the palette has to reach the
// same writers --details does, and threading a second argument through sixteen
// of them makes every one of their signatures a list. The zero value is the
// plain, uncoloured, summary-only report, which is what the tests want and what
